# Object-oriented Programming - Dependency Injection (interfaces)

## Learning Objectives
- Use interfaces to improve maintainability of an application
- Use interfaces to reduce concrete dependency of classes
- Explain that interfaces are a blueprint for concrete implementations

The packages are already added to this repository but if you were adding the System.Speech Nuget package to a project you would need to do the following:  


-  In the Package Manager Console make sure you have your Default project set to: **workshop.console** 
- then run the following command:  ``` install-package system.speech ```
